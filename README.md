# ðŸ“š Generalised Data Structures Library

### ðŸ”¹ Technology

C, C++, Java

### ðŸ”¹ Project Overview

The **Generalised Data Structures Library** is a collection of **generic implementations of major data structures** in C, C++, and Java. It is designed to provide **ready-to-use and reusable modules** that implement both **fundamental** and **advanced operations** on a wide range of **linear** and **non-linear data structures**.

The **Generalised Data Structures Library** is a multi-language project developed using **C, C++, and Java**. It is designed as a reusable library that provides **generic implementations of all major data structures**, allowing developers to directly use pre-built and optimized operations without having to write them from scratch. The library covers both **linear data structures** such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues, as well as **non-linear data structures** including trees, graphs, and hash tables.

One of the core strengths of this project is its **generic approach**. By using **templates in C++** and **generics in Java**, the implementations are highly flexible and can be applied to any data type. In C, the modular design ensures efficient and reusable code. The project also follows **object-oriented design principles** (in C++ and Java), which makes the code modular, maintainable, and scalable for real-world applications.

This library is particularly useful for **students, educators, and developers** who want to save time and effort by reusing ready-made implementations of fundamental and advanced operations. It can be used as a foundation for academic learning, competitive programming, and professional software development. By using this library, developers can focus more on **problem-solving and logic building** rather than re-implementing data structures every time.

In short, the **Generalised Data Structures Library** serves as a **powerful, flexible, and ready-to-use toolkit** for anyone working with data structures in C, C++, or Java.
